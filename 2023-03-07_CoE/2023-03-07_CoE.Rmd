# Who am I?

international history / digital humanities / (digital) memory studies

# Setting the scene: history in an era of networks, data and cognitive delegation

History (and historians) within a precise social, political, technological context.

## History, computing and datafication: an old challenge

The rise of computing, networks and data since 1945.

- 1959 (dealing with too much data): François Furet and Adeline Daumard. ‘[Méthodes de l’Histoire sociale: les Archives notariales et la Mécanographie](http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/ahess_0395-2649_1959_num_14_4_2865)’. *Annales ESC*, 14(4).

- 1961 (cross-referencing two datasets): Paul Garelli and Jean-Claude Gardin. ‘[Étude Par Ordinateurs Des Établissements Assyriens En Cappadoce](http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/ahess_0395-2649_1961_num_16_5_420758?luceneQuery=%28%28%2B%28cappadoce%29+%2B%28ordinateurs%29%29+AND+%28+%2Baccess_right%3A%28free%29+%29%29+AND+%28indexable_type%3Aarticlepag%3F%29&words=cappadoce&words=ordinateurs&words=free&words=articlepag)’. *Annales ESC*, 16(5).

## Datafication?

- More than digitization
- The transformation of digitized (and born digital) material into data that can be computed and hence analysed
- The ideology that those data can represent better the society (or the past) than analog (traditional) interpretations

<small>Mayer-Schönberger, Viktor, and Kenneth Cukier. *Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work, and Think*. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2013.</small>

## At the root of datafication: (personal) computer and networks

- 1980s: rise of personal computing
- 1990s: internet / web
- 2000s: social media / platformization of the web (*i.e.* big data)
- 2010s: AI (Machine/deep learning)

## History and cognitive delegation

- Some historians seized those evolutions from the very beginning
- Emergence of *Digital Humanities* and *Digital History* since the mid-2000s
- Many projects that uses AI

Ex:
- [Trésor des Chartes](http://himanis.huma-num.fr/app//)
- [Transkribus](https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/)

## The difficult question of the historian's computing skills

French case:

- End of the 1970s: French Medievists rise the question of teaching computing in History
- 1986: Jean-Philippe Genet: Genet, Jean-Philippe. ‘[Histoire, Informatique, Mesure](https://doi.org/10.3406/hism.1986.904)’. Histoire & Mesure, 1(1), 1986.
- 1993: Genet, Jean-Philippe. ‘La Formation Informatique Des Historiens En France: Une Urgence’. Mémoire Vive, no. 9.
- 2011: Ruiz, Émilien, and Franziska Heimburger. ‘Faire de l’histoire à l’ère Numérique : Retours d’expériences’. Revue d’histoire Moderne et Contemporaine, n° 58-4bis.
- 2019: dhiparis. ‘[Enseigner le numérique aux historien·ne·s – perspectives internationales #dhiha8](https://dhiha.hypotheses.org/2619)’. Digital Humanities à l’Institut historique allemand.

# The rise of Digital History?

## The datafication of History

### Mass digitization of primary (and secondary) sources + cheap computing + network:

- Transition from primary sources to dataset
- The emergence of the big data of the past

### Platformization of the web:

- The emergebce of new primary sources (ex: social media)

## New challenges:

### Preservation

- Rosenzweig, Roy. ‘[Scarcity or Abundance? Preserving the Past in a Digital Era](https://doi.org/10.1086/529596)’. The American Historical Review, 108(3), June 2003.)

### [Democratization of history?](http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2008/05/25/everyones_a_historian_now/)

- Democratization through Accessibility
- No democratization of methodology

## Revisiting old primary sources through digitization

### The case of digitized Newspapers

- Newspapers as the most digitized kind of primary sources
- Renewal of media history
- Numerous projects based on digitised newspapers (= form of datafication)
  - Oceanic Exchanges, Numapress, Impresso...
  
## The Impresso Project

- Swiss project (EPFL, Université de Lausanne, University of Zürich) with Luxemburgish partnership (C<sup><small>2</sup></small>DH)

- Bunout, Estelle, et al., eds. *Digitised Newspapers – A New Eldorado for Historians? Tools, Methodology, Epistemology, and the Changing Practices of Writing History in the Context of Historical Newspapers Mass Digitization*. De Gruyter Oldenbourg, 2022.


## Taking into account the datafication phenomenon

## Big data of the Past and the Big data flaws

Boyd, Danah, and Kate Crawford. ‘[CRITICAL QUESTIONS FOR BIG DATA: Provocations for a Cultural, Technological, and Scholarly Phenomenon](https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2012.678878)’. Information, Communication & Society, 15(5), 2012.

## Big data if the past and the lamp post effect

## Exploring new sources: the example of social media

- New Sources for future historians
- Today's sources for historians (sociologists, linguists...) interested in the link between history and collective (cultural) memory

Ex: #ww1: echoes of the Centenary of the Great War on Twitter

## Fragility

Well. Elon Musk.

# How to teach history in the digital world?

## The diversity of the echoes of the past

Most citizens are confronted to the (historical) past in a non-academic / secondary education context.

- The most striking example is video games

## The non-existence of a digital native generation

- There's no digital native generation
- Maybe Facebook (or Snapchat, or Instagram, or Whatsapp, etc -- depending on places and time) native generation

**We should not assume that our students are better fitted to the datafied world we are living in.**

## basics are still valid...

- The importance of primary sources
- The importance of methodology
- The importance of reading

## ...but to be updated

# Conclusion: we should be timelords
