<h1>digital memory studies</h1>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Just a few words about me:</p>
<p>I’m currently an assistant professor in european contemporary history
at the Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (university of
Luxembourg).</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m coming from international history but turned to digital
humanities (depending on the definition you have of DH) and digital
history;</li>
<li>then started to study online commemoration and hence turned to
digital memory studies;</li>
<li>I particularly researched echoes of the Centenary of the Great War
on Twitter and online commemoratins of the end of the second world war
during the 2020 French and Italian lockdowns (in this case a reseach led
with Deborah Paci for a book coordinated by Orli Fridman and Sarah
Gensburger)</li>
</ul>
<p>So I’m now in the field of digital memory studies – while still being
a historian as memory studies are a lot about litterary studies.</p>
<p>Here, i’m trying to wonder what we can do with new artefacts of the
big data / AI era. It’s a starting project, even only an idea yet. To be
honest, I’m not even sure it’s DH.</p>

french legionary, walking in a field, with black smoke of a fire in
background</a></p>
</blockquote>
<aside class="notes">
<p>You probably all have already seen that kind of images, generated by
AI systems, here available through a search engine called <a
href="https://lexica.art">lexica.art</a>. This search engine allows to
find images generated by AI systems(mostly stable diffusion and their
own engine, <em>Lexica Aperture</em> that I suppose is an optimized
version of stable diffusion).</p>
<p>Lexica.art created this search engine by harvesting generated images
published on the Discord Stable diffusion server. Ther’s a
‘semantic’-ish system associated to it (they speak of ‘image
relevancy’), as this image and its prompt were found through the keyword
‘Napoléon’.</p>
<p>There are many thing to say here:</p>
<ul>
<li>the helmet looks absolutely wrong, and really not French – the
spiked helmet evokes more something German, the form is somewhere
between the Wermacht and Darth Vader.</li>
<li>it doesn’t look at all like a French legionary,</li>
</ul>
<p>Historically it’s just nonsense.</p>

<p>Well british history’s not my specialty, but here again, there are

<aside class="notes">
<p>Of course having a look at what ChatGPT – here with GPT-4 as its
engine, but believe me it’s as bad as the GPT-3.5 version. Concepts are
badly used, there are time inconcistencies (the use of ‘Union
européenne’ in a pre-Maastricht treaty for instance. And there are
mistakes: Jean Monnet did not have any influence on the Treaty of Rome,
it’s even uite far from his own coneption.</p>
<p>And of course there are things strangely missing: Monnet as working
in finance and adminsitration, it’s true, but he started his career as a
Cognac seller – which is why he knew quite well the USA and could get
there during WW2.</p>

</section>
<section id="biases-and-primary-sources" class="slide level2">
<h2>biases and primary sources</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>WHy do I say all that, knowing that in the past few months, anyone
reasonable enough (that excludes Elon Musl and Sam Altman) has made the
same observations? Why would that be of interest to (digital)
historians?</p>
<p>We can make two points here:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>there are on one side all the debate around ethics, embedded
(western male white) biases in those systems. And more specifically, the
training datasets that those AI-based systems have been trained on.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>training datasets can be seen as primary sources that embeds
interpretations of the past, interpretations that are specific to the
societies AI is developped in (Western). Which could imply that we
should ask for their publication – which in some cases is illusory as
private firms won’t publish their training dataset;</li>
<li>these training datasets can also be put into the context of concepts
that have been used a lot – probably too much – lately (Hartog’s
presentism, Gumbrecht broad present or even Chakrabarthy’s Anthropocene
Time - that can make the link with time in AI and Kate Crawford’s work)
<ul>
<li>Basically, if we take the example of GPT, as it is trained on a
dataset that stopped in 2021, it is also embedding a fixed way of those
society to see the world.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>All this have been discussed and is currently discussed quite
extensively.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>There is a second point.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>there are on the other side the data – that can be also
considered primary sources, born-digital primary sources – that are
generated by those systems.</p></li>
<li><p>those primary sources can be of several nature:</p>
<ul>
<li>the metadata (who write which prompts when) – with all the privacy
and ethics issues we can imagine and that the Italian privacy
institution has already pointed out. From the historian’s point of view,
it’s primary sources in the making than ready-to-use sources and their
accessibility is questionable;</li>
<li>the images and texts generated by AI-bases systems. Lot’s of
generated images are public – with many controversial aspects in terms
of, let’s say, plagiarism. It’s a bit more complicated with generated
texts. Those primary sources in the making will be used to understand
those embedded biases (and, for our concern, interpretations of the
past) that are clearly present in those systems <em>via</em> the
training datasets.</li>
<li>then, there are the prompts.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</aside>

<section id="questionning-the-past" class="title-slide slide level1">
<h1>questionning the past</h1>
<p><img src='img/07_mr_bean_napoleon.png' width='600px' /></p>
<p><small>« a portrait of Mr Bean as Napoléon Bonaparte »</small></p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Let’s go back to those generated images and texts. If those images
and texts are terrible, why are they still interesting?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Questionning the past is one of the core activity of historians /
and other humanists / social scientists working on the past;</p></li>
<li><p>It’s our basic epistemologic operation in the sense that we ask
questions to start the process of elaborating new knowledge about the
past.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that tools (image or text generative systems), easy to use,
are based on prompts – which are often explicit or implicit
questions.</p>
<p>Those systems are huge incentives to question the world around us,
and the world that was. That should not let us indifferent.</p>
<p>At least does it not leave me indifferent, all the more that some of
those prompts contain references to the past.</p>
<p>It’s all the more interesting that those system could be defined as
a-epistemological: when you use ChatGPT, for instance, there’s no notion
of truth, lie, knowledge in the way those systems are working.</p>

<h1>prompts as open doors <br />to users’ imagination about the
past?</h1>

<aside class="notes">
<p>So, as an historian, what interest me the most in LLMs or similar
system, whether they generate images or texts, are not those systems,
are not what they produce, but what is necessary to produce them:
prompts – of course when they evoke the post. The text that we need to
enter to get images or texts – images can also be entered, but let’s
stick for now to text –, that’s a new kind of primary sources
potentially linked to the past.</p>
<ul>
<li>prompts can be seen as open doors to users’ imagination about the
past – of course, it’s much more complex than that, but nevertheless,
we’ll use this as a sort of hypothesis;</li>
<li>So LLM or text-to-image system, if we follow this hypothesis, can be
seen as not only text-to-image or text-to-text but also as system that,
as an aside, are generating primary sources on collective memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Napoléon is a good example of what could be studies:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, let’s be clear, in those prompts history often means
war;</li>
<li>Because Napoléon is linked to episodes and concepts that are some of
the basis of European history
<ul>
<li>empire / slavery</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Because even within Europe, ways to consider this part of French and
European history is definitly diverse (something French citizens do
usually not understand – in Spain, Napoleon’s massacre are almost as
traumatic as the Spanish civil war)</li>

<aside class="notes">
<p>My problem here is that it’s not that easy to get a balanced corpus
of prompts. I’m working on that, and can for now name only a few
leads.</p>
<p>Of course, all ethics and privacy issues are still to be managed.</p>
<ul>
<li>contacting AI-systems developers and firms
<ul>
<li>craiyon: did not keep time-date informations up to now;</li>
<li>no way openAI is accepting – and not sure I want to work with
them;</li>
<li>Stable Diffusion</li>
<li>For midjourney, I need to investigate more, but can only be done
with a paid subscription and not sure gives the right to</li>
</ul></li>
<li>prompts search engines (lexica.art, PromptHero, craiyon, etc.)
<ul>
<li>limitation : date time informations</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Discord servers
<ul>
<li>It’s how search engines built their corpus =&gt; there could be
enough information.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>reddit
<ul>
<li>I don’t know if it’s a good tool / but easy to scrap data there</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Twitter
<ul>
<li>hashtags where people just tweet prompts + image.</li>
<li>Elon Musk’s problem: might not be possible nor pertinent.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>That’s for the source. The second point is, well, what do we mean by
‘past’?</p>
<p>So I do not have this corpus yet, but started experiments. And

<p>Up to now, I did not really speak about digital humanities and
history or digital history, though shaping the corpus might mobilize
DH-related techniques or at least digital methods (scrapping, API uses,
etc).</p>
<p>From the few elements I could get yet, of course there are some
things that we can already do. A colleague of mine developped a small
scrapping script and we could harvest some prompts. I’ve used my usual
tools <a href="https://iramuteq.org">IRaMuTeQ</a>.</p>

<h2>distant reading prompts</h2>

<aside class="notes">
<p>Here’s a sort of topic modelling (not topic modelling but the assumes
same function) of a corpus of 1908 prompts.</p>
<p>Iramuteq is basically clustering prompts based on collocations of
words. The keywords you see are words that are the most representative
of those clusters and allow for an interpretation of the clusters. There
are other, thanks to this software, ways to help the user interpret the
clustering (getting the most representative prompts of each clusters for
instance).</p>
<p>The prompts here are containing ‘european union’ - I wanted other
keywords for this presentation, but the scripts is not working anymore
so I could not collect data specifically for this presentation.</p>
<ul>
<li>it’s not only about the past, but quite a lot about</li>
<li>there are clusters about styles – note that a lot are ‘historical’
(soviet propaganda)</li>
<li>there are elements of recent politics (nigel farage / marine)</li>
<li>europe as something linked to a period of time: Middel Age
(heraldic) / 17th Century (Rembrandt)</li>
<li>notions quite linked to european history: ‘empire’</li>
<li>the question of the link with news is quite important</li>
<li>war is very present =&gt; because Europe, but it seems that there is
a global association of history and war</li>

<aside class="notes">
<p>My hypothesis was that prompts are a door to people’s imagination
about the past. It’ now that I will comment and criticize this
hypothesis.</p>
<p>Discussing this hypothesis is also switching from DH methods to
digital sociology methods: mixing data with qualitative analysis,
interviews, etc.</p>
<p>If we stick to distant reading of prompts, we do not have the whole
picture, and are missing what’s happening between the users and the
interface.</p>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>the aim here of the user was to get a nazi salute – and it’s not
working
<ul>
<li>think about the ‘Napoléon rides a shark’ image that you saw before:
it’s the same, it doesn’t work</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It’s not working for different reasons:
<ul>
<li>well, this system does not know what a nazi salute is – images here
are just pixels which succession is statistically pertinent</li>
<li>there might be limitations implemented in the text-to-image system
(not likely with stable diffusion)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>What does a user who did not get the results it wanted?</p>
<ul>
<li>as it fails, users might have strategies to get what they want
<ul>
<li>strategy based on changing prompts,</li>
<li>means that prompts, not only images (or generated text), are the
result of the settings of the machine, or at least partly, and of a
man-machine interaction.</li>

<ul>
<li>we need prompts with proper metadata and that relate to the past

</blockquote>
<aside class="notes">
<p>And as a conclusion:</p>
<p>This prompt means “Charles De Gaulle sunbathes on a beach in
Normandy”. But ‘bronze’ means also ‘bronze’ - a metal used to build
statues. Of course many details are wrong, starting with the hat, but
it’s not the point here.</p>
<p>Here, the memory context (ie embedded into the training dataset) was
stronger than the meaning the user – say, me – put in the prompt.</p>
