## blog

I used to blog on several places, that for most of them are gone, but can still be found on archive.org [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20120723191731/http://www.clavert.net/wordpress/) for instance. I also blogged on [*L'histoire numérique à l'ère contemporaine*](https://histnum.hypotheses.org) but stopped in 2022.

I am not here starting again a blogging activity, but just storing some texts that I wrote and could not publish, for a reason or another.
